I am currently a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellow** at **University College London (UCL)**, UK. Before joining UCL, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the **Light and Molecules** group led by **Prof. Mario Barbatti** at **Aix-Marseille Université**, France. I completed my PhD under the supervision of **Prof. Swapan K. Pati** at the **Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR)**, Bangalore, India.

As a computational photochemist, I specialize in organic emitters and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. My research focuses on integrating high-level electronic-structure methods with machine learning to design functional materials and to accelerate non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations through uncertainty-aware and active-learning strategies.

## Open Source Contributions
I have contributed to **ULaMDyn**, a Python-based open-source package designed to automate the unsupervised machine learning analysis of large datasets generated by non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. ULaMDyn integrates seamlessly with the **Newton-X** platform and employs advanced dimensionality-reduction and clustering techniques to uncover hidden patterns in molecular trajectories, enabling a more intuitive understanding of excited-state processes.
